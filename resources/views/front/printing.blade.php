                                       Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process where an object is created layer by layer from a digital design. Instead of cutting or shaping material, the printer builds the model gradually, allowing complex forms, fine details, and accurate dimensions. At ARC 3D, this method helps us turn digital concepts into precise physical models efficiently.

ARC 3D supports all these industries by producing architectural scale models, display models, prototypes, and functional components that help visualize, test, and present ideas more clearly.

                                        The cost depends on factors such as the size of the model, level of detail, type of material used, finishing requirements, and the number of pieces needed. At ARC 3D, we always aim to provide the most practical and cost-effective solution based on your project goals.

                                       The time depends on the size, complexity, and finishing required. Simple models can be completed quickly, while larger or more detailed projects take longer. ARC 3D focuses on delivering each project efficiently without compromising accuracy or quality.
